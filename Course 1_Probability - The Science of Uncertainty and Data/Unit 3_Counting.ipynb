For instance, in stage 3, we have a node N1 that has 3 possible choices, and on a separate branch, a stage 3 node N2 that has 5 different choices. In this case, how do we calculate the total number of possible outcomes?\n",

    "Answer by sudarsanvsr_mit (Staff)\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes the tree structure can be used where each stage corresponds to different possibilities applicable to one selected position in a sequential manner in these type of problems.\\\n",
    "For second Q, you just have to add all possibilities leading from each branch as there is no stage consistency(branches from each branch) you cannot multiply each stage possibilities to get the total possibilities as shown in lecture video.\n",
    "It takes too much time draw tree structure for bigger problems so it is better for you to practise using the procedure professor is following."
