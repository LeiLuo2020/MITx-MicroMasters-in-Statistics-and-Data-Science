    "**Question:** Couples can buy a special type of life insurance, under which benefits will be paid to their children after both people have passed away.The total cost to the couple of this kind of insurance consists of fixed monthly payments until the passing of both of them. Based on a model of life expectancy for individuals, how do we find the distribution and the expectation of the total insurance cost? How would the answer change if the lifetimes of the two people are correlated? \n",
