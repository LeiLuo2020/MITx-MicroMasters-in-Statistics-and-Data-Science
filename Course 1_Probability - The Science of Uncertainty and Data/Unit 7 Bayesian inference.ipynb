    "In this unit, we focus on Bayesian inference, including both hypothesis testing and estimation problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "a) We apply the Bayes rule to find the posterior distribution of an unknown random variable given one or multiple observations of related random variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) We discuss the most common methods for coming up with a point estimate of the unknown random variable (Maximum a Posteriori probability estimate, Least Mean Squares estimate, and Linear Least Mean Squares estimate).\n",
    "\n",
    "c) We consider the question of performance analysis, namely, the calculation of the probability of error in hypothesis testing problems or the calculation of the mean squared error in estimation problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "d) To illustrate the methodology, we pay special attention to a few canonical problems such as linear normal models and the problem of estimating the unknown bias of a coin.\n",

    "Illustration of the update of the posterior distribution. The file that is linked here(see beta plot pdf) illustrates the updating of the Beta posterior distribution of the bias of a coin, as more and more coin flips are observed, starting with a uniform prior (in red, in the figures). Suppose that the true value of the bias is  0.3 . We generate independent samples of the coin flips, and each figure shows the resulting posterior (in blue). For example, the third figure shows the posterior if we observe one Heads and one Tails. In order to illustrate the evaluation of the posterior, we also show (in black) all of the previous posteriors. In the last figure, after 64 flips that resulted in 19 Heads, the posterior shown (in blue) is centered in the vicinity of the true value. On the other hand, the posterior has a substantial width, indicating that there is still significant uncertainty about the true value of the coin bias.\n",
